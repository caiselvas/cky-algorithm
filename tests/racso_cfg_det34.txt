# Exercise 34: Non-ambiguous CFG for {xcy | x, y ∈ {a, b}* ∧ |x|aba = |y|bab}
# Write a non-ambiguous CFG generating the words of the form xcy, where x, y are words over {a, b} such that the number of occurrences of aba in x is equal to the number of occurrences of bab in y.

CFG
S -> aA | bS | I
A -> aA | bB | I
B -> aC | bS | I
C -> Ca | Db
D -> Ea | Db
E -> Ca | Fb
F -> aF | bG | J
G -> aD | bH | J
H -> aF | bH | J
I -> Ia | Jb | c
J -> Ka | Jb | c
K -> Ia | c
