# Exercise 37: Non-ambiguous CFG for {acy | x, y ∈ {a, b}* ∧ |x| = |y| ∧ |x|aa > 0}
# Write a non-ambiguous CFG generating the words of the form acy, where x, y are words over {a,b} with the same length and such that there is some occurrence of aa in x.

CFG
S -> bSa | bSb | aAb | aAa
A -> bSb | bSa | aQa | aQb
Q -> bQa | bQb | aQb | aQa | c
