# Exercise 45: CFG for {a^n b^m c^k d^t | n = m ∨ n = k ∨ n = t}
# Write a CFG (which will be ambiguous) generating the words of the form a^n b^m c^k d^t where the amount of a's equals the amount of b's or the amount of c's or the amount of d's.

CFG
S -> M | K | T
M -> PCD
P -> aPb | ϵ
K -> QD
Q -> aQc | B
T -> aTd | BC
C -> cC | ϵ
B -> bB | ϵ
D -> dD | ϵ
