# Exercise 2: Non-ambiguous CFG for {a^n c b^n | n > 0}
# Write a non-ambiguous CFG generating the words over {a, b, c} such that there is an occurrence of c exactly in the middle, to its left there are only a's (and there is at least one a), and to its right there are only b's (and there is at least one b). Note that, since the only occurrence of c must be exactly in the middle, the number of a's must be equal to the number of b's.

S -> aKb
K -> aKb | c
