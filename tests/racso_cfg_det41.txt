# Exercise 41: CFG for the complement of {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0}
# Write a CFG (which will be ambiguous) generating the language of the words over {a, b, c} that are not of the form a^n b^n c^n, where n ≥ 0.

CFG
S -> XbaX | XcaX | XcbX | N | P | C
X -> aX | bX | cX | ϵ
N -> aNc | aXb | bXc | A | cC
P -> aPb | A | B
A -> aA | a
B -> bB | b
C -> cC | c | ϵ
