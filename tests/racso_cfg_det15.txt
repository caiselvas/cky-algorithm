# Exercise 15: CFG for {a^n0 b a^n1 b ... a^nm-1 b a^nm | m ≥ 1 ∧ ∃I ⊆ {1, ..., m} : (n0 = ∑i∈I ni)}
# Write a CFG (which will be ambiguous) generating the words of the form a^n0 b a^n1 b ... a^nm-1 b a^nm, with m ≥ 1, for which n0 is equal to the sum of a selection of naturals from n1, n2, ..., nm, i.e., n0 = ∑i∈I ni where I ⊆ {1, ..., m}. Note that, in particular, the selection might be empty, and therefore a word where n0 is 0 is necessarily correct.
